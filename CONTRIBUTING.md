Welcome to the Environmental Robotics Project! 🌍
First, thank you for considering contributing. It’s people like you who make open-source tools better for everyone. We are building this to solve real-world waste management issues through autonomous logic.
How Can You Help?
We are currently prioritizing the following engineering challenges:
1. PID Control Integration: Improving motor smoothness during the EVADING state.
2. GPS Mapping: Creating a coordinate-based pathing system for larger campus areas.
3. Computer Vision: Integrating ESP32-Cam logic to distinguish between "litter" and "obstacles".
Our Technical Workflow
To maintain high code quality (especially for university review), please follow these steps:
1. Fork the Repository: Create your own copy to work on.
2. Create a Feature Branch: git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature.
3. Follow the FSM Pattern: Ensure all new logic fits within the existing RobotState structure.
4. Commit with Meaning: Use descriptive messages like feat: add GPS waypoint logic.
5. Open a Pull Request (PR): Describe your changes in detail for review.
Code of Conduct
I value a respectful, collaborative environment. Be kind, be helpful, and let's build something that matters.
